Imagine a situation where you have a clock on your website. You would need to request a new value from the server every second in order to update this clock. With JavaScript, everything runs on the user\'s end without re-connecting to the server. Just imagine what a mess it would be if the clock needed to reset every second. Your webpage would have to constantly reload to update the content, destroying the user experience. With JavaScript you can update the content without reloading the webpage. What\'s more is that there are advanced libraries for JavaScript, like AJAX, that allow you to connect to the database and retrieve information without reloading the website. To sum up JavaScript \'runs\' on the web-browser of the visitor of your website.\n\nI give you 100% satisfaction. If you do not like my course, you can request a full refund up to 30 days.

It was invigorating - teaching myself the skills that would start a career.\n\nBut I often found that tutorials only showed me what methods to use. I had to piece together examples, trying to figure out why examples were working - why bugs were popping up. Even when I found a code fix, there was often that missing layer of how the update addressed the problem.\n\nIt was a grind, and the learning process could have been more efficient with better resources.\n\nFast forward five years, and I’m working as a full-stack software engineer at Zendesk in San Francisco. I often think back to those first couple years teaching myself web development.\n\nThe resources could have been better, more efficient, giving me not only what to write, but why the fix addresses the issue, and how the code works under the hood.\n\nSo that is what I’ve created in this course. A React learning experience that will give you all three of those important aspects to understanding code: what methods to use, why to use those methods, and how those methods work under the hood.\n\n\n\n*****\n\nI really believe that taking this course will be a valuable investment of your time.\n\nI’m making the first couple sections free to preview. Even if you only end up doing this free content, you’ll walk away with a complete React application, and a lot of valuable lessons learned.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\nWhy take this course from me?\n\nAs mentioned before, I’m a full-stack software engineer working at Zendesk in San Francisco.

You’ll find a healthy balance of conceptual theory, and practical hands-on experience. You’ll gain skills right from the get-go in the first section. And you’ll build interesting and relevant projects throughout the course.\n\n\n\n*****\n\nIn this course, you will:\n\nDive into React code right away. You will gain relevant experience as soon as the first section. Time is precious. And I want to make sure that you’ll never feel like you’re wasting it in this course. So in a matter of minutes, you will be writing React code in the first section, with a fully completed app by the end of it.\n\nUnderstand how React fits in the big picture of web development. In the second section, you will take an important step back and examine how React fits in the big picture of web development. You’ll build a React project from scratch - discovering all the layers that are in between the supplies that supports the React app, and the browser which displays the React app.\n\nCreate relevant and compelling React apps. I’m betting you’ll find the apps both useful and interesting. Useful ones like the portfolio app will help you both learn React, and be valuable as a completed project for your software engineering and web developer profile.

I\'m sure you\'re gonna love it!\n\n\n\n[03] Why is this course so long?\n\nReason #1: I take time to explain every single concept that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (this is a course, not a tutorial)\n\nReason #2: I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!\n\nReason #3: There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually assimilate and practice what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills\n\n\n\n[04] Here is what\'s also included in the package:\n\nUp-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)\n\nProfessional English captions (not the auto-generated ones)\n\nDownloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section\n\nDownloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)\n\nAccess to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years\n\nFree support in the course Q&A\n\n10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included)\n\n\n\n[05] This course is for you if...\n\n... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.\n\n... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.\n\n... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).\n\nBasically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON\'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.\n\n\n\nSo, does all of this sound great?

The goal of the course is to teach you how to comfortably design and develop applications in Angular in Reactive style using just plain RxJs, and nothing more.\n\nThis course comes with a running Github repository with the the finished code, as well as starting points for different sections of the course in case that you want to code along, which we recommend as its the best way to learn.\n\nThis course answers the common question: how far can we go in Angular while using only plain RxJs and nothing more, without introducing any state management library?\n\nIt turns out that the simple set of techniques taught in this course are very well suited for a wide range of applications, especially in-house built enterprise applications.\n\nIn this course, you will learn exactly how to use RxJs to design and develop both the service and the view layers of your application, and you will understand both the advantages and the pitfalls of the reactive approach.\n\nParticularly when it comes to state management, it turns out that we can already go very far by leveraging only plain Angular and RxJs techniques, without using an additional state management library like for example NgRx.\n\nThese simplified state management techniques are adequate and sufficient for a large range of applications,  and we believe that you should consider them first before thinking of adopting a full-blown state management solution.\n\nHow far can you go with these techniques? That\'s what you will find out in this course.\n\nCourse Overview\n\nWe are going to start our course by taking a small Angular application that is written in imperative style, and we are going to talk about some of the problems of that approach. Then, we are going to refactor the application and explain step-by-step how to implement it in reactive style instead.\n\nWe will explain in detail every RxJs operator that we come across in this course, the first time that we need each operator.\n\nWe are going to start with a fully stateless solution first, but later we are going to improve the user experience by applying some simple RxJs-only state management techniques. We are going to use these patterns in order to handle some of the data of the application, as well as the user authentication profile.\n\nThe key element needed to implement lightweight state management is RxJs behavior subjects so we will cover those in detail in the course. We will also provide step-by-step reactive style solutions for common UI functionality like loading indicators or error messages.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThis course covers the following topics:\n\nReview of an application written in imperative style\n\nRefactoring into stateless reactive style, understanding the benefits\n\nSmart vs Presentational Components\n\nStateless Observable Services\n\nThe shareReplay Operator\n\nStateless UI updates (without state management)\n\nIntroduction to RxJs Subjects and BehaviorSubject\n\nDecoupled component communication using shared observable services\n\nUsing Observables to have components interact at different levels of the component tree\n\nError Handling and error messages in reactive style\n\nLoading Indicators in reactive style\n\nImproving user experience with lightweight RxJs stores\n\nOptimistic UI updates\n\nManaging User Authentication state with plain RxJs\n\nLocal vs Global Services\n\nMaster Detail with cached master table in reactive style\n\nThe Single Data Observable Pattern: Avoiding nested ng-component tags\n\nRefactoring a reactive application to OnPush change detection\n\nConclusion and key takeaways\n\nWhat Will You Learn In this Course?\n\nAt the end of the course, you will feel comfortable designing and developing Angular applications in reactive style, by leveraging plain RxJs-only techniques. You will know how to apply simplified reactive state management techniques to different common use cases, and you will understand the advantages and the limitations of this approach.\n\nYou will be familiar with a series of commonly needed reactive design patterns, and you will also be familiar with a series of common pitfalls to avoid.', '16660029767.jpg', 13.99, 0, 'reactive-angular-course-with-rxjs-angular-14-709f19bc', 4, '2022-10-17 02:36:16', '2022-10-17 02:36:16'),

The features in this app are carefully designed by Mosh to help you master the core skills you need to build real-world apps with ASP.NET Core and Angular. \n\nBy the end of watching this course, you\'ll be able to:\n\nBuild APIs with ASP.NET Core\n\nTest APIs with PostMan\n\nIntegrate Angular and ASP.NET Core \n\nImplement a clean and decoupled architecture \n\nUnderstand and apply the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n\nProperly implement the repository and unit of work patterns \n\nUse the new dependency injection feature in ASP.NET Core \n\nTroubleshoot common runtime errors \n\nStore and retrieve data with Entity Framework Core (code-first workflow)\n\nUse AutoMapper \n\nImplement CRUD operations (including one-to-many and many-to-many relationships)\n\nImplement filtering, sorting and paging data\n\nHandle and logging errors \n\nDisplay toast notifications \n\nImplement cascading drop-down lists\n\nImplement photo upload with progress bars\n\nAdd authentication and authorization with Auth0 (including roles with different privileges)\n\nDisplay charts \n\nAnd more...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn top of all these, you\'ll learn how to write quality code, not just how to build apps. There are a lot of developers out there who can build apps but they write poor quality code. Mosh shows you how to refactor bad code into clean, maintainable and quality code. He also shares his knowledge and 15 years of experience about software design and architecture. So this course is more than just technology. It teaches you how to think like a software engineer. \n\n\n\nThese are the essential skills that you take with you to nearly every real-world project. Whether you want to get prepared for a job interview or simply want to take your coding skills to the next level, this course is the means to the destination. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOOLING\n\nThere are two ways to build ASP.NET Core applications. You can use Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio Code, a light-weight cross-platform code editor. In this course, Mosh uses VSCode and the command-line to build an app, but what you learn can be applied in Visual Studio 2017 as well. \n\n\n\n\n\nWHO THIS COURSE IS FOR \n\nIn order to take this course, you should have at least 3 months experience with ASP.NET MVC 5, Entity Framework 6 and Angular 2 (or higher). \n\nIf you need to strengthen your understanding of these frameworks, you can watch Mosh\'s related courses prior to or in parallel with this course: \n\nAngular 2 with TypeScript for Beginners\n\nThe Complete ASP.NET MVC 5 Course\n\nEntity Framework 6 in Depth \n\n\n\n60 DAY CHALLENGE PROGRAM \n\nDepending on your level of experience, there are different ways to take this course. You can watch it, section by section, just like other courses. You may prefer to code along with the videos or watch a section first and then code. \n\nBut if you like to get out of your comfort zone and take your coding skills to the next level, you should take advantage of the 60 day challenge program that comes with this course. \n\nImagine you and Mosh are team mates and are working on a real-world project. Every week Mosh gives you a challenge or a task to complete. You have one week to complete this task. The following week he publishes a new section and shows you how he completes that task himself. This is a fantastic learning opportunity for you. You can compare your code with his and find areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT THIS COURSE IS NOT \n\nWhile you use ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework to build an app, the focus of this course is on application building skills and not a deep overview of ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework. Because in any real-world applications, you use only a subset of the features in any frameworks. So, it\'s impossible to cover everything about ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework in one app. But you\'ll learn about the key things that you need to know in order to get the job done. \n\nAlso, the following topics are outside the scope of this course: \n\nComplex domains and domain-driven design (DDD)\n\nDesign patterns\n\nContinuous integration and deployment\n\nAutomated testing\n\nFinally, the application you\'ll build in this course has a very simple user interface since the focus of this course is on coding not building visually engaging user interfaces. \n\n\n\n\n\nTAKE YOUR CODING SKILLS TO THE NEXT LEVEL \n\nSo, do you want to transition from ASP.NET MVC 5 and learn about the latest stuff happening in .NET Core? Do you want to learn how to build a real-world application with ASP.NET Core and Angular? Then take this course and get started. \n\n\n\nThis course comes with a 30-day money back guarantee. If you\'re not satisfied, you can contact Udemy for a full refund.

The goal of this course is to give you all the tools necessary for you to be able to do your own open source Angular Library.\n\nWe will build a series of small open source libraries of progressively increasing difficulty, and we will learn a large number of Angular advanced features in a very fun and practical way.\n\nWhat Is The Best Way To Learn Advanced Angular Features?\nThe best way to learn Angular and its most advanced features is to simply take and use it to build something very concrete, like for example an application or a library - and do it in a step-by-step way, as there is no replacement for that experience.\n\nIn order to understand a technology, we really need to build something non-trivial with it - blog posts and docs will only get us so far.\n\nThis is of course very time-consuming to do without any help because we will have to learn everything by ourselves along the way as we build something, gluing together an endless number of blog posts, documentation and Stackoverflow answers.\n\nSo because of this, in order to really dive deep into Angular we will be using it to build a series of small reusable libraries. The goal is to create a practice scenario, and learn the advanced features of Angular in their original use cases, where they make the most sense and so are easier to learn.\n\nWhat Libraries Will We Build In This Course?\nWe will be building the following libraries, and learn how to publish them on NPM using the Angular Package Format: We will start by doing a Font Awesome customizable Input Box and learn the advantages of designing our components using content projection over a more input/output based design. At this stage we will also introduce the Angular Testing ecosystem.\n\nThen we will progressively increase the difficulty of each library: we will build a dynamic tab container that allows to receive a template as a component input, effectively allowing to override parts of the component template while keeping a default look and feel for the component.\n\nWe will then build a reusable dynamic modal component with customizable content. This component have its contents configurable via either content projection or an input template, and will introduce the notion of Structural Directives.\n\nWe will also learn how directives and components of a given module can interact in a transparent way, independently of the place where they are used in the template, using a shared library service. We will then build a Input mask directive, where we will cover some advanced keyboard handling behavior.\n\nAt the end of the course, we are going to take all the components and directives that we built in previous sections, and we are going to build one larger example using them: A Payment Modal Widget!\n\nWe will then introduce the Angular Animations module, and use it to animate the modal widget, we will see how to define animations that can be reused across components.\n\nWhat Will you Learn In this Course?\nWe will learn how to create an AOT compatible library in the Angular Package Format, how to define a library module, how to isolate the styles of a component but still make them customizable, how to design components and directives to make them easier to maintain - making them customizable while at the same time giving the components great default behavior.\n\nWe will cover all of the more advanced features of Angular, including Component API Design, Component Styling best practices, Templates and Template Outlets, ng-content, ng-container, style isolation and customization, AOT, global events, debugging with the CLI, @ViewChildren, @ContentChildren, Light DOM vs Shadow DOM, @HostBinding, @HostListener, dynamic components, directives, handling keyboard events, testing, animations and more (this is a non-extensive list).\n\nBut more than presenting the features in isolation, we will use them in real use cases which will make the features much easier to learn.\n\nWhat Will You Be Able to do at the End Of This Course?\nBy the end of this course you will know many of the most advanced features of Angular, but most of all you will know when to use them and why. You will know how to build open source Angular libraries, and know how to make them available to the open source community on NPM.\n\nWith this advanced course, you will have a rock-solid foundation on Angular: you will very likely be able to tackle the more advanced Angular development tasks that you will come across in your day to day job or personal projects.\n\n\nHave a look at the course free lessons below, and please enjoy the course!', '166600333510.jpg', 14.99, 0, 'angular-advanced-masterclass-free-e-book-78d40237', 4, '2022-10-17 02:42:15', '2022-10-17 02:42:15'),

And while that may sound daunting, it really is not and you\'ll see why.\nYou code in the same language, both on the server and on the front end ! We\'re all polyglots (we use multiple programming languages and syntax in most of our projects), but managing code in the same language on the back-end and the front-end never hurts and in-fact can be a huge time saver when debugging.\nNodeJS is used by the likes of LinkedIn, Yahoo and Microsoft to name a few. Its pretty new and consequently you gain advantage from the exponentially growing community of NodeJS & Javascript developers and that\'s great fun, really !\nIf you\'ve been coding in Javascript, you can leverage your existing knowledge and skills and take it to a whole new level !\n\n\nThe Real Problem\n\nSo, NodeJS sounds pretty interesting so far, but what really hit me in the face when I was learning all about Node was the fact that, with any new platform, framework or technology, you need to take baby steps, all the way through, to making real world examples, if you have to get to the grips of it. And that leads us to why you\'re here.\n\nIn this course, we\'ll go from absolute scratch, all the way up to building and deploying full blown NodeJS app on the Cloud !\n\nProject Oriented Learning\n\nWith NodeJS, we will build two full blown apps. We will go all the from concept creation, UI/UX design to coding and deploying our app on the cloud.\n\nA. ChatCAT - One of the fun things that you can do with NodeJS is build realtime apps that allow a high number of concurrent users to interact with each other. Examples of this kind include Chat Servers, Gaming Servers, Collaborative Tools etc. We will build a multi-room chat server that allows users to login via Facebook, Create Chatrooms of their choice and Chat in realtime. We will not only create this app, but also deploy it on Heroku and Digital Ocean !\n\nYou will learn all about using Websockets, Structuring your App in an efficient manner, creating and using development & production configurations, Authentication using Facebook, Setting up an App on Facebook, Managing Sessions, Querying & Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Heroku & Digital Ocean\'s Cloud Services and lots more...\n\nB. PhotoGRID - The second complete app that we will build in this course is a Photo Gallery app which lets users upload images into a gallery with the ability to vote up the images that they like. This NodeJS app lets users upload files, which are then resized to thumbnails on the server and stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket for optimal delivery to the front end interface. The entire app runs on an Amazon EC2 Cloud Server which we will create from scratch and configure for use.\n\nYou will learn about managing file uploads using NodeJS & AJAX, Resizing Images on the Server, Accessing & Storing files in an S3 Bucket, Querying & Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Amazon\'s Elastic IP Service & Cloudfront distribution, ensuring your NodeJS app runs automatically even if the server is restarted and lots more...\n\nIn the projects above, we leave no stone unturned in terms of execution. This is a complete hands-on course that is not just limited to NodeJS but to the ecosystem that needs attention when a NodeJS app is built and deployed. My intent is hand hold you all the way from writing your first app to deploying production level apps on the cloud.\n\nAnd I\'m always available to personally help you out, should you get stuck.\n\nBONUS :: Here\'s the best thing about this course. The curriculum that you see gets you up and running with NodeJS & Cloud Deployment. However, there is so much more that you can do with NodeJS, which is why I will keep adding new lectures and sections to this course on an ongoing basis.

(73, 'Node.js: The Complete Guide to Build RESTful APIs (2018)', 'Learn to build fast, scalable and secure RESTful services with Node, Express and MongoDB, from setup to production\r\n', NULL, 'About this Course\n\nNodeJS is a platform that allows developers to write server side high performance and networked applications. And that too using good old Javascript. But wait ! Isn\'t Javascript meant to be used for forms and stuff on web pages ?\n\nWell that was 10 years ago. The world has gone from \'Oops! You\'ve not filled up the form properly !\' days to today\'s modern web apps and social media sites that rely heavily on Javascript. Google Apps, Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and LinkedIn, being handful examples of this movement. And to think that this quantum leap would not have been possible without Javascript is not an overstatement. Today, when you socialize with your friends on Facebook, or use your Gmail inbox, you\'re running thousands of lines of code written in Javascript, in your browser.\n\nWith Node JS, you can take this knowledge back on the server, where usually you would expect to see the likes of PHP, Ruby, ASP dot NET etc. But that\'s only a small portion of the reason why NodeJS is so cool. The fact that you can write full blown networked applications (think chat servers, collaborative tools, real-time data visualisation apps) with just a few lines of code is more than reason enough to not only look at NodeJS, but deep dive into it !\n\nBut I know PHP ? Why should I learn NodeJS ? Well, for starters, learning something new never hurts. But most importantly, learning NodeJS is great because :\n\nNode allows you to write highly scalable networked apps deployed on the cloud !\nYou\'re working at a different level of application design per se with Node and that means that you\'re not writing an app that sits on top of a stack, you design the stack from the server up. And while that may sound daunting, it really is not and you\'ll see why.\nYou code in the same language, both on the server and on the front end ! We\'re all polyglots (we use multiple programming languages and syntax in most of our projects), but managing code in the same language on the back-end and the front-end never hurts and in-fact can be a huge time saver when debugging.\nNodeJS is used by the likes of LinkedIn, Yahoo and Microsoft to name a few. Its pretty new and consequently you gain advantage from the exponentially growing community of NodeJS & Javascript developers and that\'s great fun, really !\nIf you\'ve been coding in Javascript, you can leverage your existing knowledge and skills and take it to a whole new level !\n\n\nThe Real Problem\n\nSo, NodeJS sounds pretty interesting so far, but what really hit me in the face when I was learning all about Node was the fact that, with any new platform, framework or technology, you need to take baby steps, all the way through, to making real world examples, if you have to get to the grips of it. And that leads us to why you\'re here.\n\nIn this course, we\'ll go from absolute scratch, all the way up to building and deploying full blown NodeJS app on the Cloud !\n\nProject Oriented Learning\n\nWith NodeJS, we will build two full blown apps. We will go all the from concept creation, UI/UX design to coding and deploying our app on the cloud.\n\nA. ChatCAT - One of the fun things that you can do with NodeJS is build realtime apps that allow a high number of concurrent users to interact with each other. Examples of this kind include Chat Servers, Gaming Servers, Collaborative Tools etc. We will build a multi-room chat server that allows users to login via Facebook, Create Chatrooms of their choice and Chat in realtime. We will not only create this app, but also deploy it on Heroku and Digital Ocean !\n\nYou will learn all about using Websockets, Structuring your App in an efficient manner, creating and using development & production configurations, Authentication using Facebook, Setting up an App on Facebook, Managing Sessions, Querying & Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Heroku & Digital Ocean\'s Cloud Services and lots more...\n\nB. PhotoGRID - The second complete app that we will build in this course is a Photo Gallery app which lets users upload images into a gallery with the ability to vote up the images that they like. This NodeJS app lets users upload files, which are then resized to thumbnails on the server and stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket for optimal delivery to the front end interface. The entire app runs on an Amazon EC2 Cloud Server which we will create from scratch and configure for use.\n\nYou will learn about managing file uploads using NodeJS & AJAX, Resizing Images on the Server, Accessing & Storing files in an S3 Bucket, Querying & Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Amazon\'s Elastic IP Service & Cloudfront distribution, ensuring your NodeJS app runs automatically even if the server is restarted and lots more...\n\nIn the projects above, we leave no stone unturned in terms of execution. This is a complete hands-on course that is not just limited to NodeJS but to the ecosystem that needs attention when a NodeJS app is built and deployed. My intent is hand hold you all the way from writing your first app to deploying production level apps on the cloud.\n\nAnd I\'m always available to personally help you out, should you get stuck.\n\nBONUS :: Here\'s the best thing about this course.

That means that if you already know Javascript, you are ready to take this course.  Typescript adds in several important features to Javascript, including a type system.  This type system is designed to help you catch errors during development, rather than when you are running your code.  That means you\'ll be twice as productive by catching bugs earlier in development.  But besides the type system, Typescript also provides several tools for structuring large codebases and writing truly reusable code.\n\nMastering Typescript by reading the documentation alone is challenging.  Although you might know what a \'typed array\' or an \'interface\' is, the documentation (and other courses!) don\'t show you where to use this features, or how to use them effectively.  The goal of this course is to help you understand why each feature of Typescript exists, and exactly where to use them.\n\nTop companies are hungry for Typescript developers.  Some of the largest web apps today are being built with Typescript.  Employers are scrambling to find engineers who are fluent with this cutting edge system.  Solid knowledge of Typescript will make you far more employable, by giving you a unique skill that few other engineers possess.\n\nPlanning on building your own apps?  Using Typescript will help you structure your project correctly from day one, ensuring that you won\'t be crushed under technical debt at some critical stage of your company.  In this course, you\'ll learn how to write reusable code, with a tremendous emphasis on leveraging classes and interfaces to make swappable \'widgets\'.  You will be able to reconfigure your apps on the fly to build wildly different features with only a minimum amount of effort\n\nLearn from someone who has worked on one of the largest Typescript projects around. On professional projects of my own, I have developed plugins for an open-source, browser-based code editor called Theia.

I will wait here...\n\n...\n\nAmazing, right? What if you knew exactly how to design and build a website like that, completely from scratch? How amazing would that be?\n\nWell, I\'m here to teach you HTML, CSS, and web design, all by building the stunning website that you just saw, step-by-step.\n\nSo, after finishing this course, you will know exactly how to build a beautiful, professional, and ready-to-launch website just like Omnifood, by following a 7-step process. And it will even look great on any computer, tablet, and smartphone.\n\nBut what if you want to build a completely different website? Well, no problem! I designed the course curriculum with exactly this goal: to enable you to design and build any website that you can think of, not just copy the course project.\n\n\n\nSo, in order to become a confident and independent developer, capable of building your own websites in the future, you will learn:\n\nThe fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project (www.omnifood.dev). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!\n\nHow to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!).\n\nHow to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs\n\nHow to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design)\n\nHow to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching\n\nHow to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons\n\nImportant developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools\n\nDoes this sound like fun? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start building websites today!\n\nOr are you not sold yet and need to know more? No problem, just keep reading...\n\n\n\n[01] Why should you learn HTML and CSS in the first place?\n\nBuilding websites allows you to do fun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well. Web development is one of the most future-proof and highest-paying industries in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!\n\nBut you already know all this, that\'s why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place!\n\nThis is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It\'s an all-in-one package that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day.\n\n\n\n[02] Why is this course so unique and popular?\n\nReason #1: The course is completely project-based\n\nSimple demos are boring, and therefore you\'re gonna learn everything by building actual projects! In the final project (www.omnifood.dev), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a fictional company that I made up just for the course.\n\n\n\nReason #2: You will not just learn how to code\n\nCoding is great, but it\'s not everything! That\'s why we will go through the entire 7-step process of building and launching our website project.\n\nSo the huge Omnifood project will teach you real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites: how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.\n\nOn top of that, this course has a huge focus on beautiful design. In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.\n\n\n\nReason #3: I\'m the right teacher for you\n\nWith the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be quite easy and fun to learn. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that\'s where I come in.\n\nMy name is Jonas, I\'m an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy\'s top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.\n\nUsing that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and designed the ideal course curriculum for every type of student. It\'s a unique blend of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I\'m sure you\'re gonna love it!\n\n\n\n[03] Why is this course so long?\n\nReason #1: I take time to explain every single concept that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (this is a course, not a tutorial)\n\nReason #2: I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!\n\nReason #3: There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually assimilate and practice what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills\n\n\n\n[04] Here is what\'s also included in the package:\n\nUp-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)\n\nProfessional English captions (not the auto-generated ones)\n\nDownloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section\n\nDownloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)\n\nAccess to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years\n\nFree support in the course Q&A\n\n10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included)\n\n\n\n[05] This course is for you if...\n\n... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.\n\n... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.\n\n... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).\n\nBasically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON\'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.\n\n\n\nSo, does all of this sound great?

This is a course on Redux Saga and not on Redux or React.\n\n\n\nRedux saga is a library that aims to make application side effects, like data fetching / calling an API, easier to manage, more efficient to execute, and better at handling failures.\n\n\n\nRedux saga is an impressively clean way to separate logic to call API endpoints and update your redux state based on redux actions. The redux saga library\'s sagas are implemented as Generator functions that yield objects to the redux-saga middleware. The yielded objects are a kind of instruction to be interpreted by the middleware. When a Promise is yielded to the middleware, the middleware will suspend the Saga until the Promise completes. Once the Promise is resolved, the middleware will resume the Saga, executing code until the next yield. \n\n\n\nThe control that redux saga brings is way beyond any other libraries, such as redux thunk. You have full control of how redux sagas are called, when they\'re called, and the type of work they do, as well as how they influence the redux store.\n\nIn this fast-track introductory course, you will learn:\n\nHow redux saga fits in to a front end single page application, using React and Redux.\n\nWhat redux sagas are.\n\nHow to query an API with redux saga - and deal with the response.\n\nHow to set up a redux saga to listen for dispatched redux actions and the various ways to set up redux saga to listen for dispatched actions.\n\nActually dispatch redux actions from a redux saga and update your redux application state.\n\nLearn key redux saga concepts and patterns such as take, takeEvery, takeLatest, fork, put, call as well as blocking and non-blocking calls.\n\nLearn some ES6 syntax and learn about Generator functions in Javascript.\n\nYou might\'ve used redux-thunk before to handle your data fetching - after taking this course I\'m confident you\'ll switch to using Redux Saga for your future projects!\n\n\n\nWhat other students are saying about this course:\n\n5/5 stars - \"i found the course to be great.. I\'m building an application at work which was using Redux-thunk and using what Tom has taught in the course I have remove Redux-Thunk in favour of Redux-Saga and clean up a lot of code. Another reason i like this course as it was only about Redux-Saga. I didn\'t have watch 5hrs of React & Redux just to get to the part about Redux-Sagas. It was only an afternoon watching and following along and now I feel that I understand Redux-Saga enough to actually use it in a application and know what I\'m doing Thanks Tom\" - Stefen Hasselberg\n\n\n\n5/5 stars - \"This course is exactly what I needed. I hadn\'t used redux saga before and recently inherited a project that uses it and found it difficult to understand what was going on. This course has helped me a lot in understanding the basics of redux saga - the lecture on javascript generators and the cheat sheet is super helpful - especially the examples in the cheat sheet of when to use certain effects. Overall a great introduction to redux saga. Thanks Tom!\" - Carol Emma\n\n\n\n5/5 stars - \"So far, very clear and concise explanations with a nice initial overview of the redux-saga process. Look forward to the rest of this course.\" - Douglas Hanson\n\n\n\n5/5 stars - \"Great starting point for learning redux-saga from scratch. Haven\'t finished yet, but so far I\'m convinced I\'ll be using saga for future projects. I\'m now almost at the end of this abbreviated course, and I\'d recommend for everyone who uses Redux by far. It\'s very well done.\" - Steve Bailey', '16662514061.jpg', 13.99, 0, 'redux-saga-with-react-fast-track-redux-saga-intro-course-3a063774', 2, '2022-10-19 23:36:46', '2022-10-19 23:36:46'),

If you are the type of person who gets the most out of learning \'by doing\', then this course will be for you.\n\nPlease note that we do not start from zero coding knowledge.   Whilst this is aimed at beginner/intermediate level, you will need to have some basic javascript knowledge (not a lot is needed) or if you are coming from another programming language then you should be fine with this course.  It\'s designed to take you from beginner level to having the skills to build a much more significant application.\n\nWhat do we do on this course\n\nWe are building a social events application, much like Facebook events or Meetup.
